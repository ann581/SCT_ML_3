Project Title: Dog vs Cat Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Project Description:
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle Dog/Cats dataset. The goal is to build an image classification model that accurately predicts whether an input image contains a cat or a dog using SVM with appropriate feature extraction techniques.

Key Highlights:
- Used Kaggle's Dog/Cats dataset for training and testing
- Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization)
- Extracted features (e.g., using HOG or CNN embeddings)
- Trained an SVM classifier for binary image classification
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Demonstrated SVM applicability in image classification tasks
